**Project: Predicting Body Measurements for Adult Females**

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two datasets: "nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020" and "nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020"
- Developed and tested multiple regression algorithms to predict body measurements for adult females based on other attributes
- Evaluated and compared the performance of different algorithms
- Created visualizations to illustrate relationships between variables


**Skills Utilized:**

- Data analysis and visualization
- Regression modeling and algorithm development
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Statistical inference and model evaluation
